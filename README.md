# Efficient Risk Management Solution
## Intro
Companies whose businesses require buying and selling currency, commodities, or other assets at a market price are subject to the risk of losing significant amounts of money due to undesirable fluctuations in that price. The best solution for such enterprises is to use hedging strategies. This leads to reasonable questions:
+ What strategy should be chosen?
+ What risks are eliminated and what is the price of it?
+ What are the possible values of all cashflows during one/two year(s)?
+ What is the difference between distributions of total cashflows for different hedging strategies or in case of absence of hedging?

The purpose of this project is to help a company answer all those questions, including choosing a hedging strategy wisely, as well as to have a clear vision of the possible outcomes and increase confidence about the future.

The program studies the history of returns of a given asset, then uses Monte Carlo simulation of returns during a future period with different statistical distributions and parameters, estimated specifically for the asset. This simulation is used to estimate the distribution of total payments during the year given the cashflows of a company with and without applying hedging to those cashflows.

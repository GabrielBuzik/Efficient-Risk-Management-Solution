# Efficient Risk Management Solution
---
The Companies, whose business require buying/selling currency, commodities or other assets, given a market price, are subject to risk of loosing signifficant ammounts of money due to undesirable fluctuations of that price. The best solution for such enterprises is using hedging strategies. 
This leads to reasonable questions:
+ What strategy should be chosen?
+ What risks are eliminated and what is the price of it?
+ What are the possible values of all cashflows during one/two year(s) given all possible motions of market variables?
+ What is the difference between distributions of total cashflows for different hedging strategies or in case of absence of hedging?
The purpose of this project is to help a company answer all those questions, including choosing a hedging strategy wisely as well as to have a clear vision on the possible outcomes and rise confidence about the future.

The program studies the history of returns of a given asset, then uses Monte Carlo simulation of returns during a future period with different statistical distributions and parameters, estimated specifically for the asset. This simulation is used to estimate distribution of total payments during the year given the cashflows of a company with and without applying hedging to those cashflows.
